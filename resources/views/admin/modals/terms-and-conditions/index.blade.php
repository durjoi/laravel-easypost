                            of certain Products at any time and without advanced notice, but such termination will not
                            affect any
                            Products for which you have already accepted an offer, which is good for thirty (30) days,
                            except as
                            set forth in Section 9 below. Tronics Pay reserves the right to cancel any Purchase and

                            Condition Defined for Trade-In and Purchase. Tronics Pay uses three (3) basic Product
                            conditions to
                            grade Products for Trade-In, ranging from "Flawless" or "No Noticeable Flaws" to "Broken" or
                            "Functional or physical problems." Conditions can vary widely between categories and types
                            of
                            Products. Broadly, Tronics Pay's Product definitions are as follows: Flawless or No
                            Noticeable
                            flaws: the item looks like it has never been used and is 100% functional. Good or Normal
                            wear
                            and tear: the item has visible signs of use, but is otherwise 100% functional. Broken or
                            Functional
                            or physical problems: the item does not turn on, one or more Product functions is
                            non-operative or
                            the item has serious physical damage that inhibits use (e.g. broken or cracked screen or
                            missing
                            parts). The above definitions are broad guidelines. More specific condition definitions
                            specific
                            to the category and/ or type of Product may be included on the Tronics Pay Website offer
                            screen and
                            serve as the effective condition definition for that product. Condition definitions are
                            subject to
                            change at Tronics Pay's discretion. If you are uncertain about your Product's condition,
                            please
                            seek guidance by contacting Tronics Pay's customer care.

                            Tronics Pay offers three (3) product conditions for purchase: (i) "Tronics Pay Certified
                            Fair",
                            which means all product features work (except for those requiring carrier service or data
                            plans,
                            which must be purchased separately if so desired) and the device may feature some wear and
                            tear
                            that does not affect the functionality of the phone; (ii) "Tronics Pay Certified Good",
                            which means
                            all Product features work (as noted above) and there may be light scuffs or nicks that do
                            not affect
                            the functionality of the phone; (iii) and "Tronics Pay Certified Excellent", which means the
                            device
                            is in like-new condition.

                            All products available for purchase are, where applicable, eligible for activation on the
                            carrier
                            network identified for that particular device. It is important to select your specific
                            carrier
                            when purchasing a Tronics Pay certified pre owned device, as we can only guarantee it to
                            work with
                            the selected carrier. For example, we can only guarantee that a Tronics Pay certified AT&T
                            device
                            can be activated on AT&T; we cannot guarantee that it can be activated on any other carrier
                            and we
                            cannot guarantee that it can be unlocked.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We can also only guarantee that your Tronics Pay certified pre owned device will work
                            domestically
                            within the United States. We cannot guarantee that it will work internationally.

                            Product Valuation. All offers will be based on Tronics Pay's own determination of the
                            Product
                            value in reliance on the accuracy of the information you supply us. Tronics Pay will use its
                            discretion to determine the Product value, weighing factors that may include the Product's
                            model,
                            functionality and condition and whether necessary Product accessories have been provided by
                            you.
                            Upon receiving an offer, you have the option of accepting or rejecting that offer.
                            Acceptance
                            indicates you are willing to provide your Product to Tronics Pay at the offered price. If
                            you do
                            not accept Tronics Pay's offer, the specific transaction expires. If after rejecting the
                            offer
                            you change your mind and want to accept the offer, you will need to open another transaction
                            with us at which point, assuming the Product is still eligible for purchase, the new offer
                            may be
                            different as Product prices are subject to change

                            activated for
                            new service (unless the Product is incapable of being activated because it is in "Broken"
                            condition).
                            The Products and the sale and shipment of such items to Tronics Pay: (a) must comply with

                            (including copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets or other proprietary rights), and
                            (c) shall
                            not be counterfeit, stolen, or fraudulent. You represent and warrant that the Products are
                            free of any
                            liens or encumbrances, including third-party software which may not be transferred or for
                            which
                            royalties are due. By using the Tronics Pay Services, you agree to indemnify Tronics Pay
                            from all
                            claims or losses sustained by Tronics Pay as a result of any breach of your representations
                            and
                            warranties. It is your responsibility to discontinue phone, Internet and/or any similar

                            use of
                            the Services. It is also your responsibility to remove any security codes that would prevent

                            Sending Tronics Pay Your Product for Trade-In or Return. When packaging your Product, be
                            sure to

                            items you told us about when the offer was calculated, or sending us a Product which does
                            not match
                            your original description, may impact the final value of your Product and may result in a

                            Removing Data From Your Product. For Products involving devices that store files and/or
                            personal
                            data on hard drives, memory chips or the like, you must back up and store any data you wish
                            to keep
                            from your Product and remove any personal information from the Product before you send your
                            Product
                            to us for Trade-In. Likewise for Products you Purchase from Tronics Pay and return to
                            Tronics Pay
                            in accordance with these Terms, you agree to remove any such data from the Product prior to
                            returning
                            the Product to Tronics Pay. Tronics Pay's standard practice is to remove all such data from
                            the
                            Product; however, Tronics Pay makes no guarantee that it will do so. By sending Tronics Pay

                            Product, you agree to release us from any claim as to the Product, the data stored in such
                            Product,

                            confidentiality, disclosure or use. Tronics Pay is not responsible for: (a) any loss
                            suffered by you
                            due to any data that is not erased from the device and transferred to a third party, or (b)
                            any
                            loss of data after you submitted the Product to us.

                            Product Inspection; Offer Recalculation. Your Trade-in Product must be received by Tronics
                            Pay within thirty (30) days after you accept the original offer provided by Tronics Pay and
                            complete the check- out process on the Tronics Pay Website (the "Delivery Period") or the
                            offer shall automatically expire. Packing and shipping recommendations provided to you by
                            Tronics Pay should be followed in order to avoid possible damage to or loss of the Product
                            in transit. Tronics Pay will inspect all Products that are received. Tronics Pay has the
                            option to accept or reject the Product, including without limitation, to reject any Product
                            not conforming to the description you provided to us, any Product modified in such a way
                            that it no longer conforms to the original factory specifications, any Product no longer
                            complying with applicable laws or regulations (e.g., FCC rules, etc.) and/or any Product
                            damaged or lost in transit. If Tronics Pay rejects the Product for any of these reasons, the
                            original offer automatically expires and is rescinded. Tronics Pay reserves the right to
                            revoke the original offer and provide a revised offer for the Product if: (a) the Product
                            and/or materials are not as described, (b) the Product is received by Tronics Pay after the
                            Delivery Period, and/or (c) Tronics Pay receives Product(s) that are different from those
                            identified when your offer was calculated. As described above, Tronics Pay typically honors
                            the offer price you receive for your Product on the Site for a period of thirty (30 days);
                            sometimes for a longer period of time in connection with a temporary extended price-lock
                            offer (each a "Price-Lock Offer"). Notwithstanding any Price-Lock Offer, Tronics Pay always
                            reserves the right to recalculate the original offer price and provide a revised offer for
                            the Product if, during the Price-Lock Offer period, the market price for your Product has
                            declined by more than thirty percent. Tronics Pay shall determine the market price during
                            such applicable period and whether there has been any such decline in its sole discretion.
                            If you elect not to accept the recalculated offer price, your Product will be returned to
                            you.

                        <p>
                            ecalculated Product Offers after Inspection. In the event Tronics Pay recalculates the offer
                            it provided for the Product after it has been received and inspected for Trade-In, as
                            described above, you shall have the option of accepting or rejecting the new offer. If you
                            accept the new offer, you will be paid in the normal course and in accordance with these
                            service terms. If you reject the new offer, Tronics Pay will return the Product to you at
                            the address from which it was originally sent. Tronics Pay will give you a period of five
                            (5) days after Tronics Pay presents you with a recalculated offer via email at the address
                            you provided to accept or reject the new offer (the "New Offer Period"). Tronics Pay will
                            also remind you of the outstanding new offer one or more times during the New Offer Period.
                            However, if the new offer is neither affirmatively accepted nor rejected by you during the
                            New Offer Period, the new offer will be deemed to have been accepted by you and you will be
                            paid the new offer price in the normal course and in accordance with these service terms.
                            For the avoidance of doubt, your acceptance of the original offer and/or any new offer is
                            final and you may not change your mind later about accepting such an offer.

                            Releasing Rights to Product. Once you send Tronics Pay your Product for Trade-In, Tronics
                            Pay cannot and does not guarantee that it will be able to honor any request for return of
                            the Product and/or any data or information contained in such Product. Of course, if Tronics
                            Pay rejects the Product or you do not accept any new offer for the Product pursuant to
                            Sections 9 and 10 ("Return Circumstances"), your Product will be returned to you as set
                            forth in Sections 9 and 10.

                        <p>
                            Risk-Of-Loss. You remain responsible for the risk-of-loss for the Products sent to Tronics
                            Pay for Trade-In until delivery of the same to Tronics Pay. You are responsible for any
                            damages that may occur to your Product while in transit. Tronics Pay is responsible for
                            risk-of-loss when it opens the packaging containing your Product and ceases in the event
                            Tronics Pay returns your product to you for any reason. For the avoidance of doubt, in such
                            an event, risk of loss will be transferred to you once Tronics Pay delivers the package to
                            the carrier for return to you and you will bear the risk-of-loss while the Product is in
                            transit.

                            If you return a Product to Tronics Pay that you Purchased, you are responsible for the
                            risk-of-loss for the Product until Tronics Pay receives the Product. You are responsible for
                            any damages that may occur to the Product while in transit back to Tronics Pay.

                            Passing of Title. Title to the applicable Product sent to Tronics Pay for Trade-In passes to
                            Tronics Pay upon Tronics Pay's acceptance of the Product for the original offer or the new
                            offer, as applicable. If there is a Return Circumstance, title shall not pass and shall
                            remain with you.

                            Non-Transferable. Any offer by Tronics Pay for your Product for Trade-In is non-
                            transferable and not redeemable for any other consideration other than what is offered by
                            Tronics Pay.

                            Import and Export Laws. You agree to comply fully with all import and export laws,
                            regulations, rules and orders of the United States, or any foreign government agency or
                            authority, and that you will not directly or indirectly transfer any Product without proper
                            authorization from the U.S. and/or foreign government. You bear responsibility for and
                            assume all expenses relating to your compliance with the described laws, regulations, rules
                            and orders, and for obtaining all necessary authorizations and clearances in order to convey
                            any Product to Tronics Pay in connection with a Trade-In, including without limitation,
                            valuation, classification and duties applicable with the import of any goods. Please note:
                            U.S. trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) generally
                            prohibit the importation into the United States (including U.S. territories), either
                            directly or indirectly, of most goods, technology, or services (except information and
                            informational materials) from, or which originated from Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North
                            Korea, Serbia, or Sudan; from foreign persons designated by the Secretary of State as having
                            promoted the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; named Foreign Terrorist
                            Organizations; designated terrorists and narcotics traffickers. You may not offer or provide
                            to Tronics Pay for sale, any Products that would violate the provisions of this Section 15.

                            Promotions. From time to time, and at Tronics Pay's sole discretion, Tronics Pay may offer
                            promotional programs as an incentive to customers. Promotions applicable to payments are
                            applied as an increment to the final value of a customer's Product, but they are not
                            considered a change in that final value. Promotional programs have explicitly defined terms,
                            including but not limited to, expiration, usage per person and per transaction, and other
                            limitations and restrictions. Unless otherwise stated, promotions must be applied by you
                            before checkout. For the avoidance of doubt, once checkout is completed, promotions cannot
                            be applied to the same transaction. Tronics Pay reserves the right, in its sole discretion,
                            to cancel or refuse promotions.

                            Accuracy of all Information. Tronics Pay makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of all
                            information you receive in relation to your Product. From time to time, however, there may
                            be typographical errors, technical inaccuracies, pricing or other errors or omissions. As
                            such, Tronics Pay reserves the right, at any time prior to payment, to:(a) Correct an error.
                            (b) Change the offer or cancel the Purchase prior to your receipt of the Product. In the
                            event the Product has already been sent to Tronics Pay for Trade-In, the changed offer will
                            become a New Offer subject to the processes set forth in Section 9 and Section 10.
                            Otherwise, the changed offer will be a reissued original offer, which you may accept or
                            reject. (c) Void a transaction. If the Product was already sent to Tronics Pay, Tronics Pay
                            will be deemed to have rejected the Product resulting in a Return Circumstance subject to
                            Section 11.
